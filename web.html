                <p>What is the Python programming language?
Python is an interpreted programming language (also called a scripting language), created in 1990 by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum, following his experience working on the education-focused ABC language at CWI. Python differs from other programming languages, as it prioritizes code readability and use of whitespace over compact, tiny source files.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected (through reference counting and cycle detection), supports object-oriented and structured programming fully, and largely supports functional and aspect-oriented programming, making it particularly versatile and applicable for a wide variety of use cases.</p>
